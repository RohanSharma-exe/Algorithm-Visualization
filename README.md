# Pathfinding Visualization with Pygame

**Introduction**

This project provides interactive visualizations of various pathfinding algorithms implemented using Pygame in Python. It offers a compelling way to explore and understand how these algorithms work in real-time.

**Supported Algorithms**

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A guaranteed shortest path algorithm that systematically explores all neighbors of a node before moving on.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores a single path as far as possible before backtracking. Not ideal for shortest paths but can be useful for finding any solution.
- **A* Search:** A heuristic-based algorithm that combines distance to the goal (heuristic) with actual distance traveled, often finding the optimal path efficiently.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Similar to A* but doesn't use a heuristic, making it suitable for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.
- **[Optional] Other Algorithms:** Feel free to add more algorithms like Jump Point Search (JPS) or Bidirectional Search for further exploration.

**Features**

- **Interactive Grid:**
    - Create grids of various sizes.
    - Click and drag to define obstacles.
    - Set starting and ending points for pathfinding.
- **Visualization:**
    - Clear visual representation of the grid and pathfinding process.
    - Different colors for nodes, obstacles, start/end points, and the final path.
    - Optional animation to illustrate the algorithm's steps (consider adding a speed control for user preference).
- **User Controls:**
    - Choose the pathfinding algorithm to visualize.
    - Reset the grid and pathfinding process.
    - [Optional] Adjust grid size or pathfinding parameters if supported by your algorithms.

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/RohanSharma-exe/Algorithm-Visualization`.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pygame`

**Usage**

1. Run the `main.py` script: `python main.py`
2. The visualization will open in a Pygame window.
3. Interact with the grid and select options using your mouse:
    - Click and drag to create obstacles (consider adding a button or key press to toggle obstacle placement mode).
    - Click to set the starting and end points.
    - Choose the pathfinding algorithm from a dropdown menu (or a dedicated button).
    - Click the "Run" button (or a key press) to start the visualization.
    - Click the "Reset" button (or a key press) to clear the grid and path.

**Customization**

- You can modify the grid size, node colors, and other visual elements in the file.
- Consider adding comments within the code to clarify specific functionalities and areas for customization.

**Additional Notes**

- Feel free to enhance the visualization with different animations, sound effects (optional), or performance optimizations for larger grids.
- Explore implementing additional pathfinding algorithms to expand the scope of this project.
- Consider unit testing your code to ensure correctness and maintainability.
